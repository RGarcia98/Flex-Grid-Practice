container:

We set the container that is holding the items to `display: flex;` allows us to use all of the flex properties 
we have `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap` flex direction tells flex what direction we want items to be displayed
flex-direction - has row, colmn, row-reverse, colmn-reverse
flex-wrap- has nowrap, warp and wrap reverse

To keep code clean and save lines in css we can use `flex-flow: "direction" "wrap"` - combines both direction and wrap

`Justify-content:` lets us adjust items from the MAIN-AXIS 
safe values to use flex start, flex end, center because not all web browsers use the others

`align-items` is to adjust items on the cross-axis and aligns them we can align them to the center bottom baseline 
lots of ways to align but what i found is that `align-items: stretch` will not work if item's heights are already
defined because the align items will be over writen and align items depends on the height of the container if you want 
to use flex-end to work.

align-content helps with the way items wrap around 


individual elements:

order - changes the order an item is in the list 

flex grow makes the elemnt grow depending if there is extra space not in use

flex - flex: <flex-grow>< flex-shrink>< flex- basis>
default is 0 1 auto

align self - changes the alignment of the individual element
